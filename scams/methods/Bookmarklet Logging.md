## General Summary

**Bookmarklet Logging** is the process of grabbing a token using a bookmark that has JavaScript. This scam is especially dangerous because those who don't know how to code won't suspect a thing.

## History

There isn't much history about this scam as running JavaScript in a bookmark has existed a really long time, however in 2022 a few servers are telling you to verify your account with a website that contains a bookmark, this however doesn't do what it really says.

## How It Works

> DO NOT TRY ANYTHING MENTIONED TO ANYONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF.

A bookmarklet is created like this `javascript:console.log('im cool ðŸ˜Ž')` (this one is harmless), however multiple users have created a bookmark that takes your token and sends it using a webhook like this: https://github.com/entity9/discord-bookmark-grabber/blob/main/grabber.js.
