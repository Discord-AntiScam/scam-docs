# Malicious OAuth2 App
- [General Summary](#general-summary)
- [History](#history)
- [How It Works](#how-it-works)

## General Summary
A **malicious OAuth2 app** can take your data such as your guilds, email, your connections (such as GitHub, YouTube, etc.). It can also make you join servers, without you knowing, whenever it wants.

## History
OAuth2 Applications were added to Discord around June 2016. However there isn't much information on how and when the scam was started.

## How It Works
> This is safe and can be used on anyone.

An OAuth app is used when inviting a Discord bot, so when you are adding a Discord bot a request is being sent to Discord and if there are other parameters and a redirect URI, a **not** dangerous token is sent to the application requesting for the OAuth.
